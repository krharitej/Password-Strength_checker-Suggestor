# Password-Strength_checker-Suggestor
This tool determines the strength of your password based of different criteria. If the password is not strong enough it suggests a strong one generating random sequence of characters and stores the user credentials in a local SQL Database. (NOTE: To store in the database, the user must establish connection to local SQL Database server address)
